# Obscuro: Secure Code Encryption & Compilation

## Overview
**Obscuro** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to secure your source code and files. It provides robust encryption for any file type and offers specialized handling for Python files, compiling them into binary extensions to protect intellectual property while maintaining functionality.

## Key Features

### 1. AES-256-GCM Encryption
Obscuro uses industry-standard **AES-256-GCM** (Galois/Counter Mode) encryption. This ensures:
- **Confidentiality**: Data is unreadable without the password.
- **Integrity**: Any tampering with the encrypted file is detected (via the GCM auth tag).
- **Security**: Uses a unique random Salt and IV for every encryption operation.

### 2. Python Binary Compilation (Cython)
For Python (`.py`) files, Obscuro goes beyond simple encryption:
- **Compilation**: It compiles your Python code into a binary shared library (`.so` on Linux/Mac, `.pyd` on Windows) using **Cython**.
- **Importability**: The generated binaries are fully importable by other Python scripts, just like normal Python modules.
- **Stable ABI**: It targets the Python Stable ABI (Application Binary Interface), ensuring compatibility across different Python versions (e.g., a binary compiled on Python 3.9 can often run on 3.10+).
- **Source Protection**: The original source code is encrypted and removed, leaving only the compiled binary for execution.

### 3. Seamless Integration
- **Context Menu**: Right-click any file in the VS Code Explorer to "Obscure" (encrypt) or "Reveal" (decrypt).
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary build artifacts are automatically cleaned up.
- **Safety Checks**: Prevents accidental creation of non-usable binaries by verifying Cython installation and prompting the user.

## Installation

1.  Install the `obscuro-2.0.0.vsix` file in VS Code.
2.  Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
3.  The extension will automatically help you install **Cython** and **setuptools** if they are missing.

## Usage

### Encrypting a File
1.  Right-click on a file (e.g., `logic.py`) in the Explorer.
2.  Select **Obscuro: Obscure File**.
3.  Enter a strong password.
4.  Confirm the password.
5.  **Result**:
    - `logic.py` is removed.
    - `logic.py.obscuro` (encrypted source) is created.
    - `logic.so` (compiled binary) is created (for Python files).

### Decrypting a File
1.  Right-click on an encrypted file (e.g., `logic.py.obscuro`).
2.  Select **Obscuro: Reveal File**.
3.  Enter the password.
4.  **Result**:
    - `logic.py` is restored.
    - `logic.so` is removed.
    - `logic.py.obscuro` is removed.

## Technical Requirements

- **VS Code**: Version 1.80.0 or higher.
- **OS**: Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- **Python**: Python 3.x installed and available in the system PATH or workspace virtual environment.
- **Dependencies**: `cython` and `setuptools` (installed automatically via pip).
- **Compiler**: `gcc` (Linux/Mac) or MSVC (Windows) is required for Cython compilation.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Cython compilation failed"**: Ensure you have a C compiler installed (`sudo apt install build-essential` on Ubuntu, or Build Tools for Visual Studio on Windows).
- **"Externally managed environment"**: On some modern Linux distros, global pip installs are restricted. Obscuro attempts to handle this, but using a virtual environment (`.venv`) is recommended.
